        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>This work was completed while I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Professor Virginia Ferguson's Biomimechanics and Biomimetics Lab at the University of
            Colorado, Boulder. The main idea behind this research project was to examine the effects of FSH on bone microarchitecture, with a longer term goal of understanding
            how the differences in microarchitecture, if present, changed the strength of the bone across FSHB genotype and gender. Around 30 samples of mouse femurs were used
            with 6 groups of combinations of M/F genders and FSHB+/+,FSH+/-, and FSH-/- genotypes. I imaged the distal region of each of the samples using a Zeiss MicroCT Scanner,
            which provided CT images (3D X-rays) down to single-digit micron resolution. Each scan of the sample yielded a stack of .tiff images, which were cross-sections, that 
            were then stitched together using Dragonfly. Once the images were in Dragonfly, I used available algorithms to visually segment the cortical bone from the trabecular
            bone and then touched up each image in the stack by hand to correct any errors, which was a very tedious process. Once I had the images stitched together and segmented,
            I could use the software to analyze some of the morphometric values for each of the samples, such as trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and trabecular spacing (tb.Sp).
            Once I collected all of the morphometric data for each of the samples, I was able to run a 2-way ANOVA with post-hoc statistical tests to statistically analyze the 
            differences between the different experimental groups. Unfortunately, the sample number was too low to have enough statistical power to demonstrate any significant differences
            between the groups, but the data did seem promising, should we have obtained more samples to image. However, I was able to present the initial work from this study at a 
            local conference, the CU Orthapedic Symposium, where I was a finalist for the Mack Clayton Visiting Trainee Award after presenting my work and poster to judges. I was
            also able to write an <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9391273/" target="_blank">abstract</a>, as first author, to accompany a handful of visually representative images from the study that was published in Molecular Reproduction and
            Development in a VISIONS article.
